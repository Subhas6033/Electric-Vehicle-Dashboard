# Electric Vehicle Dashboard

This is a frontend dashboard built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to visualize electric vehicle (EV) data. The dashboard allows users to explore various metrics, charts, and tables related to electric vehicles, such as VIN, County, Make, Model Year, Electric Range, and more. It includes a search feature to filter data based on City, Country, Company, Model, and Year.

The project uses **Papa Parse** to convert CSV files into JSON format for easier data processing and visualization.
